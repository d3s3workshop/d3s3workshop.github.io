# Call for Papers

We invite researchers working at the intersection of machine learning and simulation techniques (e.g., physics, graphics, molecular systems) to submit their latest work to our workshop.
Accepted papers will be presented as posters during the poster session.

## Topics

We are seeking submissions in topics including, but not limited to:
  - Differentiable simulators and neural surrogates in various domains (e.g., graphics, EM-wave propagation, physics, molecular systems)
  - Probabilistic Inverse Problems (e.g., simulation-based inference, posterior and likelihood estimation)
  - Probabilistic Simulation (e.g. probabilistic ODE and PDE solvers, uncertainty quantification in operators, especially for data assimilation)
  - Techniques to speed-up simulation (e.g., neural surrogates, efficient blackbox optimization)
  - Improving simulation accuracy (e.g., mitigating sim2real gap, learnable formulation)
  - Hybrid simulation and rendering approaches (e.g., neural fields)
  - Generative modelling for simulation (e.g., biomolecule structure synthesis, material generation, image generation for autonomous vehicles)
  - Datasets, gyms, and simulation softwares

## Important Dates

- Submission deadline: August 23rd 2024, AoE
- Acceptance notification: September 23rd, 2024, AoE
- Workshop date: December 14 or December 15, 2024
